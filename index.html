											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p> <p style="font-family:serif; color:-webkit-focus-ring-color; font-size: 20px;">Hi, my name is Yong Hui Cheah. Warren is my English name which one of my dad’s friend named me when I was young. I’m currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University and my student number is S3778714. I prefer to be contacted via sending email and s3778714@student.rmit.edu.au is my email address. I’m an international student from Malaysia. I came to Melbourne for education 5 years ago, which is in 2015. Guess what? I actually speak 5 languages, there are English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay and a dialect Hakka. Learning all these language isn’t that hard for me since I’ve been speaking them when I was young. English and Chinese(Mandarin) are the languages that required me work hard in order for me to improve my speaking and also most importantly, listening and writing. I have 2 interesting fact about myself which I think worth of sharing with others. I  go to Sunday’s church services when I’m free even though my religion is Buddhism. Another interesting thing is that I studied all main sciences subjects when I was in year 12 and I’m ended up doing IT this year !</font><br />

									<h2>Interest in IT & Ideal Job</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">

										<h3>Personal Interest</h3>
										<p>The range of my interest in Information Technology is wide. I would just like to know anything about IT right now. For examples, I want to know how some particular apps works, how do they function, what programs and codes are used in order to run it, how people or businesses uses technology in their workplaces or  in their own times and so on. Basically, I’m kind of interested in anything that is related to IT having said that, after 4 weeks of lectures and practicals, I personally find that programming is really interesting even though it gets really complicated sometimes. Working as a IT manager or something related to business in a company is also one of my interest, so I’m planning to take either Maters of Business or Masters of Information System after my IT degree. I don’t actually have much interest in IT until I met one of  good friends in high school. He is an expert in technology gadgets. Whenever I’m stuck or having issue with my laptop, I’ll definitely go to him and everything gets sorted out after. Watching him doing lots of those fascinating  little things in his computer, my interest on IT gradually increases, so I would say I started to like IT 3 years ago. Besides my friend, one of my dad’s friends is also the one who sparked my desire of working in a company particularly in IT department. My dad’s friends is working for a international company for more than 20 years. He is currently in Singapore, working as programmer and also the CEO of that branch in whole Singapore. His salary is a fortune. During my study, I expect myself to learn as many things that are related to IT as possible. By the end of my course, I should have a wide range of knowledge about IT or at least, a professional on what I’ve studied. Since I find that programming is quite interesting, so I’m planning  to change my course to the Bachelor of Computer Science next year if I could meet all the requirement stated because Computer Science degree allow me to study a particular field like programming in depth. If possible, I will also continue taking my masters course after completed my degree. Masters of Business (information system) is my aim, because it is specialised on how to manage technology system , especially in business or company which combine both IT in it. </p>

										<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
										<p>The reason that I chose RMIT to study IT is because I’ve heard that RMIT is one of the best university in Melbourne that offers both IT and Computer Science courses. RMIT also provide lots of practical learning for their students which apply to the real world situation, preparing us to face the challenging outside world. Besides that, RMIT also provides plenty of scholarship opportunities both local and international students. Scholarship for students especially for international students like me, it actually helps us save up a lot of money fees. We then could use those money on other stuff like for accommodations and living expenses. This makes us don’t have to too worry about paying the international student fees and helps us focus more studies.</p>

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>The role of IT architect is to evaluate system demands, then uses professional skills to design and maintain computer network for organizations and business companies. Their duties include improving, maintaining and modifying current network systems. IT architects may act as manager and are responsible for solving IT related problems and issues. In the management roles, IT architects also have the opportunity to in- charge of  the IT department in  company and are responsible for scheduling and assessing budgetary necessity which may include estimating upgrade costs or switching Internet services. This kind of job like working for a business especially in the management role which relates to IT is my dream job. This is because besides having an interest in IT, I in person like business so much. Since IT architect’s jobs involves in both business and IT field, so I think this jobs suits me well because I can work in workplace where I can find the things that I like and  have interests in.

In order to become a IT architects, qualified skills are required. A typical Bachelor’s degree in information systems management or related fields is needed to get an employment. A Mater’s degree would give a better advantage. An entry-level position as a systems architect can provide the necessary experience for a higher-level position. Entry-level job duties for IT architect might include planning and supervising projects, solving issues, and participating in meetings. Higher-level job duties include providing development support and assistance, writing processes, recording results, and managing projects. As an IT architect, 4 main skills are needed. There are IT, design ,sector and consulting knowledge. The skills that I will have after graduated from my Bachelor’s degree would be just enough for me to start my career. New graduates usually begin with introductory classes, such as knowledge organization, database creation and operating system basics, those who have advanced in the course may go through more deeply into intermediate topics including management support systems, network security and system design. For the senior position, usually a minimum of 5 years of experience are required. The plan that I currently have for me to become a IT architect is to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. This is the lowest requirement. After that, participating in internship. Internship program that are offered provide hands-on experience for fresh graduates. The experience gained can be invaluable when looking for employment.
A master degree would also give a more advantage when looking for job that required more knowledge and skills. Below is the link to the job:

I am also an easy going person which I can easily agree to people ideas and thoughts, lacking self-thoughts. These personality that I have both give me advantages and disadvantages when working in a team. The advantages are I don’t often upset people when having group discussions. I care about other’s feelings and respect every people’s thoughts.  One of the disadvantages is that I don’t have my own thinking and thoughts. I might have one, but I will change my mind easily when others are suggesting and sharing their ideas. This can importantly affects my performance in the jobs and gradually rely on other people instead thinking myself or solving problems on my own. This dependence habit can be serious in forming a team and taking the responsibility to lead the team. Furthermore, caring people’s feelings too much may result in me making a bad decision or wasting extra resources to keep things that are not necessary. </p>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
									<p>My ideal IT project is to create a food app for the world. This food app is similar to the world’s most famous app like Uber eats. Having said that, the difference between my app and others competitor’s apps is that my food app offer a wide range of healthy meal options. The problem with obesity and overweight has always been an issue in the entire. Obesity and overweight are mainly caused by eating processed and unhealthy meal which will affect population’s overall health. Nowadays, ordering food delivery has become an normal things. Having an app that can provide a range of different healthy meal options can help reducing obesity problems.
This healthy food app is would be useful for those family which parents are busy working. This healthy food options give opportunity for those families who are actually ordering food delivery for dinner or anytime in the day and wanted to have a healthy and nutritious food. This can benefits them a lot which they don’t have to waste time in cooking their own meals. They can just take out their phones, tap open the app and starting choosing the food they like. It is just as easy as using Uber eats because this app provide delivery as well.

There are plenty of features that this app contains. My app is easy to use and suitable for all age range. Whenever people are hungry and feel like eating, they just have to go to the apps and looks for what they wanted to eat. This is has built in location which can locate where the users are and looking for the deals or restaurants nearby. They is also a wide range of different food menu in different cuisine. The users can either choose delivery method or self-pickup method to get the foods they ordered. Besides that, it also includes an easy paying method which users only have to type in their bank details once and set up a pin for future transaction. This app also merge with the after pay company which only deduct money from the bank after a month. 

In order to make this app, mobile app building platform like BuildFire can be one of the option. This is also an incredibly cost-effective option when it comes to long-term ongoing maintenance costs, keeping them under $100 per month. In the case of coding my app, Hybrid apps will have a feel of a native app because they are developed as a single code base that is deployable on both iOS and Android. While their performance can lag compared to native, this gap is getting smaller and it’s only truly applicable at the gaming level.

Basic programming skills are needed to develop this app I would say. If this project is successful, the people around the world would have a better healthy meal options to choose from. The more the people choosing over healthy food, the lover the level of obesity it would be even though this is a very long process. At least, the level of obesity of the entire world is under control and starts to get better. The problems of people having difficulties on finding healthy food on others food app will also be solved.
