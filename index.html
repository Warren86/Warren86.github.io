											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p> <p style="font-family:serif; color:-webkit-focus-ring-color; font-size: 20px;">Hi, my name is Yong Hui Cheah. Warren is my English name which one of my dad’s friend named me when I was young. I’m currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University and my student number is S3778714. I prefer to be contacted via sending email and s3778714@student.rmit.edu.au is my email address. I’m an international student from Malaysia. I came to Melbourne for education 5 years ago, which is in 2015. Guess what? I actually speak 5 languages, there are English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay and a dialect Hakka. Learning all these language isn’t that hard for me since I’ve been speaking them when I was young. English and Chinese(Mandarin) are the languages that required me work hard in order for me to improve my speaking and also most importantly, listening and writing. I have 2 interesting fact about myself which I think worth of sharing with others. I  go to Sunday’s church services when I’m free even though my religion is Buddhism. Another interesting thing is that I studied all main sciences subjects when I was in year 12 and I’m ended up doing IT this year !</font><br />

										<h3>Personal Interest</h3>
										<p>The range of my interest in Information Technology is wide. I would just like to know anything about IT right now. For examples, I want to know how some particular apps works, how do they function, what programs and codes are used in order to run it, how people or businesses uses technology in their workplaces or  in their own times and so on. Basically, I’m kind of interested in anything that is related to IT having said that, after 4 weeks of lectures and practicals, I personally find that programming is really interesting even though it gets really complicated sometimes. Working as a IT manager or something related to business in a company is also one of my interest, so I’m planning to take either Maters of Business or Masters of Information System after my IT degree. I don’t actually have much interest in IT until I met one of  good friends in high school. He is an expert in technology gadgets. Whenever I’m stuck or having issue with my laptop, I’ll definitely go to him and everything gets sorted out after. Watching him doing lots of those fascinating  little things in his computer, my interest on IT gradually increases, so I would say I started to like IT 3 years ago. Besides my friend, one of my dad’s friends is also the one who sparked my desire of working in a company particularly in IT department. My dad’s friends is working for a international company for more than 20 years. He is currently in Singapore, working as programmer and also the CEO of that branch in whole Singapore. His salary is a fortune. During my study, I expect myself to learn as many things that are related to IT as possible. By the end of my course, I should have a wide range of knowledge about IT or at least, a professional on what I’ve studied. Since I find that programming is quite interesting, so I’m planning  to change my course to the Bachelor of Computer Science next year if I could meet all the requirement stated because Computer Science degree allow me to study a particular field like programming in depth. If possible, I will also continue taking my masters course after completed my degree. Masters of Business (information system) is my aim, because it is specialised on how to manage technology system , especially in business or company which combine both IT in it. </p>

										<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
										<p>The reason that I chose RMIT to study IT is because I’ve heard that RMIT is one of the best university in Melbourne that offers both IT and Computer Science courses. RMIT also provide lots of practical learning for their students which apply to the real world situation, preparing us to face the challenging outside world. Besides that, RMIT also provides plenty of scholarship opportunities both local and international students. Scholarship for students especially for international students like me, it actually helps us save up a lot of money fees. We then could use those money on other stuff like for accommodations and living expenses. This makes us don’t have to too worry about paying the international student fees and helps us focus more studies.</p>
